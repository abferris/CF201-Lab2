      <p id="biotext">
        Hey there folks. I was born in 1991 in Seattle, Washington, where I have lived most of my life. In first grade, my best friend said "I want to be an engineer", and I said "Cool I'll be one with you" and my life went from there. I have always been mathematically minded, however I have always been a people person. I was so friendly, my grandmother was afraid I would be kidnapped as a child. Somehow I managed to grow up, and through highschool I took a number of technology courses, including CAD, computer integrated manufacturing, digital electronics (computer logic), and web design.

        After that, I proceeded to University of Portland, where I studied mechanical engineering. I had many interests, including biomechanics, however upon completion of my degree, I was unsure of if I wanted to follow the path of mechanical engineering. My senior project was so much time spent in front of a computer and crunching numbers, so I decided to go out into the world and discover what I wanted to do. After looking around, I got a retail job, and worked that for a number of years. I progressed quickly from a cashier to a senior sales associate, and eventually to a manager. I loved helping people in the store, but also helping the other associates improve and grow personally in social skills and how to sell products and themselves. As I grew, I looked at the path of my progression, and realized that the life of a store manager nor the life of anyone higher up in the food chain is not the life I wanted, constantly on call and very little return. I wanted to return to my roots of engineering, however five years makes it hard to simply jump back in.

        My oldest brother had been bothering me about doing this coding thing he had gone through. He went from having a bussing job with a math Bachelors from UW to getting employed coding, and has had a significant increase in quality of life. After talking about it with close friends, I decided that this was the path for me! I am currently working on becoming a software engineer and web developer, to use my skills and knowledge for the powers of good!

      <h2>My Philosiphy about Engineers</h2>
      <p>Engineers help people with problems, often ones they don't think about or know about yet. One of my strengths is working in cooperation with teams to cultivate strong internal and interconnected communities. As an engineers are driven by the ideal of the betterment of society by means of development of tools for those who are technically savvy and those who are occasional users. </p>
